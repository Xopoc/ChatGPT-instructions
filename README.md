A reusable set of custom instructions intended for use with ChatGPT or any other large-language model.  
The goal: provide a **clean, reliable, minimal**, copy-and-paste friendly instruction set that works in **any language**.

---

## 📄 What’s inside

- **custom-instructions.txt** — the core instruction set  
  🔗 Raw link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xopoc/ChatGPT-instructions/main/custom-instructions.txt  

You can copy the entire content directly into your model’s system prompt or Custom Instructions.

---

## ⭐ Why use this

This instruction set is designed to produce consistent, reliable, and high-quality responses from any LLM.  
The rules are **language-agnostic** — they behave identically in any language, with no translation required.

**Key benefits:**

- Separates **facts**, **opinions**, and **uncertainty** clearly.
- Encourages **best-practice**, future-aware reasoning.
- Uses web search when freshness matters and **cites factual claims**.
- Requests clarifying details instead of guessing or hallucinating.
- Provides structured reasoning:
  - pros/cons only when comparing,
  - scenarios only for forecasting.
- Keeps answers short and clear, while expanding when helpful or requested.
- Works with any language input and applies the same reasoning rules.
- Simple plain-text format — no Markdown, no formatting requirements.

## 🚀 How to use

1. Open the raw file link above.  
2. Copy the full content of `custom-instructions.txt`.

4. (Optional) Add your own personal or project details as a separate section if needed.

Nothing needs to be reformatted or translated — the file is ready as-is.
